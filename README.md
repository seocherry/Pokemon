in the test.html file, it may be short but it's complete with all the things the website needed, like the button, input box.
then the style.css file is the external file to design the website, camparing this to html, the syntax here is more easy to understand and not too complicated, we just needed to understand and remember how to
design one element.
and last the script.js file, with this file, it will show how the website should act using the different functions. for example, if we input the name of a pokemon on the input box,
displayPokemon then we click on search, this function will display the image of the pokemon, its height, weight and type.
